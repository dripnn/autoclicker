## 🚀 COMPLETE SETUP STEPS

### Step 1: Delete Your Old Repository (Start Fresh)

1. Go to https://github.com/dripnn/mc-autoclicker
2. Click **Settings** (top right)
3. Scroll all the way down
4. Click **"Delete this repository"**
5. Type the repository name to confirm
6. Delete it

### Step 2: Create a New Repository

1. Go to https://github.com
2. Click the **"+"** button (top right)
3. Click **"New repository"**
4. Name: `mc-autoclicker` (or anything you want)
5. Make it **Public** ✅
6. **DON'T** check any boxes (no README, no .gitignore, no license)
7. Click **"Create repository"**

### Step 3: Upload ALL Files

You'll see a page with upload options.

**IMPORTANT:** Click **"uploading an existing file"** link

Then:

1. **Extract this ZIP file** (final-autoclicker.zip) to a folder
2. **Open that folder** in File Explorer
3. **Select ALL files and folders** (press Ctrl+A)
   - You should see: .github, src, gradle, build.gradle, gradlew, etc.
4. **Drag ALL of them** into the GitHub upload box
5. Wait for all files to upload (you'll see a list of files)
6. Scroll down and type commit message: `Initial upload`
7. Click green **"Commit changes"** button

### Step 4: Verify Files Uploaded Correctly

After committing, you should see these folders/files in your repository:
- ✅ `.github` folder
- ✅ `src` folder
- ✅ `gradle` folder
- ✅ `build.gradle` file
- ✅ `gradlew` and `gradlew.bat` files
- ✅ All other files

**If any are missing, upload them again!**

### Step 5: Check GitHub Actions Started

1. Click the **"Actions"** tab (at the top)
2. You should see a workflow running with a yellow circle 🟡
3. It's named "Build Minecraft Mod"
4. Click on it to watch the progress

### Step 6: Wait for Build to Complete

The build takes **10-20 minutes**. You'll see these steps:
1. Set up job
2. Set up JDK 8
3. Grant execute permission for gradlew
4. **Setup Workspace** ← This takes the longest (10-15 mins)
5. Build Mod
6. Upload Mod JAR
7. Complete job

**Green checkmark ✅ = Success!**

### Step 7: Download Your Mod

When the build completes successfully:

1. Click on the completed workflow run
2. Scroll all the way down to **"Artifacts"**
3. Click **"AutoClicker-Mod"** to download
4. Extract the ZIP file
5. Inside you'll find: **`autoclicker-1.0.0.jar`** ← This is your mod!

### Step 8: Install the Mod

1. Copy `autoclicker-1.0.0.jar` to your `.minecraft/mods` folder
2. Make sure you have **Forge 1.8.9** installed
3. Launch Minecraft 1.8.9 with Forge
4. Press **R** to toggle left autoclicker
5. Press **T** to toggle right autoclicker
6. Use `/lcps 15` to set CPS!

## ⚠️ COMMON ISSUES

### "No .github folder visible"
- Windows hides folders starting with "." by default
- In File Explorer: View → Show → Hidden items ✅
- You can also just select ALL files (Ctrl+A) and upload everything

### "Build failed immediately"
- Make sure you uploaded the `gradle` folder with the `gradle-wrapper.jar` inside
- Make sure you uploaded the `src` folder with all Java files

### "Build takes forever on Setup Workspace"
- This is normal! It takes 10-15 minutes
- GitHub is decompiling Minecraft source code
- Just wait, don't cancel it

### "Can't find Artifacts"
- Make sure the build finished (green checkmark)
- Scroll ALL THE WAY down on the workflow run page
- Artifacts section is at the very bottom

---

## 🎉 THAT'S IT!

Once you download the mod JAR from Artifacts, you're done! Just copy it to your mods folder and play!

## 🔄 Need to Rebuild?

If you make changes to the code:
1. Upload the changed files to GitHub
2. Go to Actions tab
3. It will automatically rebuild
4. Or click "Re-run jobs" on any previous workflow

---

## ✅ CHECKLIST

Before uploading to GitHub, verify you have:
- [ ] .github folder (with workflows/build.yml inside)
- [ ] src folder (with Java files inside)
- [ ] gradle folder (with wrapper files inside)
- [ ] build.gradle file
- [ ] gradle.properties file
- [ ] gradlew and gradlew.bat files

Upload ALL of these to GitHub!
